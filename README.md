The Cantor set is a remarkable mathematical construct that demonstrates a set of real numbers with intriguing properties. It is a perfect example of a fractal, showcasing self-similarity and being uncountably infinite while having zero Lebesgue measure. This Python script allows you to visualize the Cantor set using a binary tree representation. The tree is constructed by recursively dividing intervals into smaller subintervals. It provides a simple way to explore the structure of the Cantor set.

The script provides two versions: one using fractions for precise representation and another using decimals for simplicity. You can choose the version that best suits your needs.

While this script offers a basic visualization of the Cantor set, it has some limitations. The depth of the tree and the precision of the representation may impact its accuracy and performance, especially for large depths. Consider these factors when using the script for in-depth exploration.
